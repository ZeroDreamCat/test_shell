# ZakoFlash

Privilege Escalation PoC when seccomp is disabled for Android 10+ with some tools.

### Features

Backup the first 32MB of mmcblk0 and the frp, boot partitions

One-click unlock frp

* You must put your device in SELinux permissive mode before using.

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroDreamCat/ZakoFlash.git
# On your device
adb shell setenforce 0
./gradlew :app:iR
# Or build in youre Android Studio
```

### Usage

1. Install and run ZakoFlash.
2. After that, click the button. This application will back up your boot partition and the first 32 MB of mmcblk0 to the /sdcard/ZakoFlash directory.

For Allwinner devices, you can analyze your device by using the 32 MB empty header at offset 0x2000, which usually contains the SPL file.

- **TOC0 header** is for secure boot, which has AVB. You must unlock the bootloader first!
- **EGON header** is for normal boot, which usually does not have a bootloader lock.

**FRP Unlock**

Modify the last byte of the frp partition to 1, then save it as `/sdcard/ZakoFlash/frp_mod.img`. Click the button to flash it. After that, you can unlock the bootloader on devices that do not have a settings application.

**Final Step**

After patching the boot image, flashing the new boot image with Magisk!

**Execute Shell Commands via Broadcast**

ZakoFlash can execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges by receiving a broadcast intent. You should open the application to let the application get ready for the root shell.

### Command Format

```bash
am broadcast -n io.zerodreamcat.zako.flash/.CommandReceiver \
  -a io.zerodreamcat.zako.flash.action.EXEC \
  --es cmd "<your command here>"
```

Example

Execute whoami (should output root):

```bash
adb shell am broadcast -n "io.zerodreamcat.zako.flash/.CommandReceiver" -a io.zerodreamcat.zako.flash.action.EXEC --es cmd "whoami"
```

Get Command Output

The command output is broadcasted as a result intent with action io.zerodreamcat.zako.flash.action.RESULT. You can listen for it using a custom broadcast receiver. For quick testing, check logcat with tag ZakoFlash:

```bash
adb logcat -s ZakoFlash:D CommandExecService:D
```

Multi-Command

You can chain commands using && or ;:

```bash
--es cmd "ls -l /data && echo 'done'"
```
